# Working With Filecoin

Ganache supports development with [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io), a decentralized storage network with built-in incentives.

It is highly recommended you checkout the <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official Filecoin development documentation</a> before getting started with Filecoin-flavored Ganache.

The documentation is split up by the various ways you can use Ganache; each page includes requirements, installation, usage, and configuration for each:
- [CLI](../getting-started/get-started-with-the-cli/)
- [GUI](../getting-started/get-started-with-the-gui/)
- [NodeJS](../getting-started/get-started-with-nodejs/)
